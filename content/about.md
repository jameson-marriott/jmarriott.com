I am a Quality Control Manager at an Aerospace Deisgn and Manufacturing firm called [RAM Company](https://ramcompany.com/) in St. George, Utah. I manage a team of 15 inspectors and oversee APQP/PPAP requirements including FAIs. I graduated from [Brigham Young Univeristy](https://www.byu.edu/) with a BS in [Manufacturing Engineering Technology](https://met.et.byu.edu/). I am a [Certified Quality Process Analysit](https://asq.org/cert/quality-process-analyst) and am working towards becoming a [Certifeid Six Sigma Black Belt](https://asq.org/cert/six-sigma-black-belt) through the [ASQ](https://asq.org/). I enjoy playing with statistics and analysis in [R](https://www.r-project.org/) with [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/).

I enjoy listening to audio books and podcasts. Some of my recent favorits are [Mindset by Carol Dweck](https://mindsetonline.com/index.html), [DataFramed by Hugo Bowne-Anderson](https://www.datacamp.com/community/podcast), and [The Secret History of the Future by Tom Standage and Seth Stevenson](https://slate.com/technology/secret-history-of-the-future).

I coded this website using the [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) package in R. It's based on the [Coder](https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder) theme for [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/). I love the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/), and frequently refer to [R for Data Science by Hadley Wickham](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) and [Text Mining with R by Julia Silge and David Robinson](https://www.tidytextmining.com/). I'm excited to get published on [R-bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/)!
