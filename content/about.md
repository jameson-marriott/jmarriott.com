I am a Quality Control Manager at an Aerospace Deign and Manufacturing firm called [RAM Company](https://ramcompany.com/) in St. George, Utah. I am the Quality Engineer for most Space and Military applications, overseeing the quality of over 150 products, some of which have been to the international space station! I graduated from [Brigham Young Univeristy](https://www.byu.edu/) with a BS in [Manufacturing Engineering Technology](https://mfgen.byu.edu/). I am a [Certified Six Sigma Black Belt](https://credentials.asq.org/09b461c1-df55-4cd6-a003-c67c010ee7a8) and a [Certified Quality Engineer](https://credentials.asq.org/4f6a312a-cb13-45b4-b5c6-6fe3ab1a3f67) through the [ASQ](https://asq.org/). I enjoy statistics and analysis in [R](https://www.r-project.org/) with [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) and the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) and [tidymodels](https://www.tidymodels.org/) packages.

I enjoy listening to audio books and podcasts. Some of my recent favorites are [Radical Candor](https://www.radicalcandor.com/) by Kim Scott and [BiggerPockets Money](https://www.biggerpockets.com/moneyshow) hosted by Scott Trench and Mindy Jensen.

I coded this website using the [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) package in R. It's based on the [Coder](https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder) theme for [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/). I'm excited to be a contributor on [R-bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/)!
