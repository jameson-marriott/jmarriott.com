<p>I have been inspired by <a href="https://xkcd.com/936/">this informative XKCD comic</a> on password security, and I often follow its advice by using random-word-generating websites. But I have to wonder what dictionaries these sites use and how random the words are that they spit out. So I thought that it would be fun to make my own generator using books from <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/">https://www.gutenberg.org/</a> as my dictionaries, that way I would at least know where they are coming from. As long as I chose books somewhat randomly, I think that should be pretty secure.</p>
<p>First I will load the required packages.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyverse)
library(gutenbergr)
library(tidytext)</code></pre>
<p>Since <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1342">Pride and Prejudice</a> is currently the most downloaded book on gutenberg over the past 30 days and I happen to like it myself, I’ll use that as my example book. It is easy to download the full text with the <code>gutenbergr</code> package.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>book_text &lt;- gutenberg_download(1342, mirror = &quot;http://mirrors.xmission.com/gutenberg/&quot;)

data(&quot;stop_words&quot;) # load stop words

book_text %&gt;%
  unnest_tokens(word, text) %&gt;% # turn the text into a single column of words
  mutate(word = str_extract(string = word, pattern = &quot;[[:alpha:]]+&quot;)) %&gt;% # remove any non-alphanumeric characters 
  select(word) %&gt;% # get rid of the extra columns
  unique() %&gt;% # get rid of duplicate words
  anti_join(stop_words, by = &quot;word&quot;) %&gt;% # get rid of boring &quot;stop&quot; words
  drop_na() %&gt;% # drop anything that didn&#39;t make it through cleanly
  unlist() %&gt;% # turn the column into a vector that sample() knows what to do with
  sample(4) # chose four words at random</code></pre>
<pre><code>##        word5412        word2152        word4936        word4259 
##       &quot;kympton&quot;     &quot;furniture&quot;      &quot;pyramids&quot; &quot;comprehension&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Well that was super easy, wasn’t it? The only thing that isn’t easy with this setup is looking up a book to use. But that can readily be solved with a shiny app. You can see the code below (at the time this post was knit—the current code will always be on github <a href="https://github.com/jameson-marriott/jmarriott.com/blob/master/shiny/password_app.R">here</a>), and the live app is at <a href="https://jameson-marriott.shinyapps.io/Password_App/">https://jameson-marriott.shinyapps.io/Password_App/</a>.</p>
