<p>I use the <a href="https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder">Hugo Coder</a> theme for this website, but I don’t like the default favicon, so I decided to make a new one using ggplot2. For those of you who don’t know, a favicon is the little icon that shows up on your browser tab next to the website name (in most browsers).</p>
<p>How hard could it be, right? As always, let’s load the <code>tidyverse</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyverse)</code></pre>
<p>First, I manually set all of the points for my graphic. This was a little tedious and involved a lot of trial and error, but for such a basic geometric shape it wasn’t too bad. Then, I plotted the points using <code>geom_path</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>favicon_data &lt;- read_table2(&quot;x y
                           .50 .00
                           .00 .66
                           .16 .9
                           .84 .9
                           1.0 .66
                           .50 .00
                           .33 .66
                           .50 .9
                           .66 .66
                           .50 .00
                           .00 .66
                           1.0 .66
                           .84 .9
                           .66 .66
                           .33 .66
                           .16 .9&quot;)

# create ggplot of favicon
favicon &lt;- favicon_data %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_path(lineend = &quot;round&quot;, linejoin = &quot;round&quot;, size = .5) +
  theme_void() +
  theme(aspect.ratio = .9) # Make it a little more squatty
favicon</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://jmarriott.com/images/favicon.svg" width="25%" height="auto"/></p>
<p>I used the convinient <code>ggsave</code> function to save an svg and 16x16 png of the favicon. The line width is a function of the plot size, so I had to reset it for the larger 32x32 favicon.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># save favicons
ggsave(&quot;favicon.svg&quot;, scale = 1, width = .25, height = .25, bg = &quot;transparent&quot;)
ggsave(&quot;favicon16.png&quot;, scale = 1, width = 1, height = 1, dpi = 16, bg = &quot;transparent&quot;)

favicon &lt;- favicon_data %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_path(lineend = &quot;round&quot;, linejoin = &quot;round&quot;, size = 1) +
  theme_void() +
  theme(aspect.ratio = .9)

# save the 32x32 favicon
ggsave(&quot;favicon32.png&quot;, plot = favicon, scale = 1, width = 1, height = 1, dpi = 32, bg = &quot;transparent&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>The svg image looks way better on my high-resolution screen, and I also figured out that svgs are human-readable, which is super cool. But it appears that the most common browsers don’t support them, so I’ll stick with the rasterized images for my website.</p>
