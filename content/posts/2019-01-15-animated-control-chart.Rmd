R is a great language for statistical process control and there are several great packages for doing that, including [qcc](https://cran.r-project.org/package=qcc), [SixSigma](https://cran.r-project.org/package=SixSigma), and a new one that I want to explore today called [ggQC](http://rcontrolcharts.com/). I've been using qcc for a while and I trust its calculations, so I'll use that to validate ggQC. 

The advantage of ggQC is that it extends [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/), so that you get all of the flexibility that comes with that, including the ability to animate plots with [gganimate](https://github.com/thomasp85/gganimate). 

First, let's import the tidyverse, qcc, and ggQC (you'll need to install these first if you haven't already). 

```{r startup, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(qcc)
library(ggQC)
```
